SWAT 3 is one of the most known classic CQB tactical games. SWAT: Elite Force is (to some people) the best way to play SWAT 4 nowadays. Since its source code is released to the public, talented modders have been working on their own visions for the game. Back To Los Angeles aims at bringing a closer and accurate experience to SWAT 3.

Main Features

The following is a very compressed list of features:

New weapons: Almost every weapon has at least one configuration to choose from; attachments such as aimpoints, suppressors and shortened barrels are available to the player. Some new weapons have been added to the arsenal.

New gear: Helmets have recieved multiple configurations to fit different roles and situations, gas masks, night vision goggles, glasses, tactical goggles and ballistic visors are available to the player. Different styles of character models have been added to allow a greater customization. 

Gameplay improvements: Back To Los Angeles offers a more faster paced and tough experience, akin to SWAT 3. Movement speed has been improved to allow faster room clearances. Score system has been revamped to bring a more authentic feel to the overall gameplay, this means that the use of Force is less penalized when it's needed; some penalties have been removed to make the overall score system less frustrating. The total amount of weight that you can carry has been reduced; adittionaly, weapons and gear now use realistic weight and bulk values to make gear choices more important and to make the player think twice about what to carry. One-in-chamber Mechanix has been added; when you perform a tactical reload, your gun will benefit from the round already in the chamber, it will be displayed with a +1 on the HUD.

New sound effects: Gun shots, explosions, footsteps, foley... All of this has been completely revamped in Back To Los Angeles. Back To Los Angeles features a vast selection of high quality sounds that have been carefully picked up to make sure that the whole experience feels more authentic.
