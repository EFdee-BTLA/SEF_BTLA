[TEC9HG]
Description=This infamous machine pistol was developed by Intratec, a Miami offshoot of the Swedish company Interdynamic. While it has relatively poor stopping power compared to full-sized submachine guns, its highly concealable form factor and ease of converting to full-auto makes it the weapon of choice for drive-bys and gang shootings. The TEC-9 received considerable noteriety in American media after the Columbine and Cleveland school shootings. After these events, the weapon was banned in several states by name and Intratec went bankrupt. Despite being a criminal weapon, a flashlight has been added for better tactical use in dark areas.

[AK47sdSynthAimpointMG]
Description=The Kalashnikov AKM was designed in the Soviet Union in 1957 by Mikhail Kalashnikov. It was officially accepted by the Soviet army in 1959, but has since been replaced by the AK-74.  It has remained in service in many third world armies as well as terrorist organizations around the world due to its dependability and the ease at which it can be maintained.  It has a slower rate of fire and lower muzzle velocity than the Colt M4A1, but uses a higher caliber bullet which makes it comparable to its American counterpart at short ranges. The synthetic stock reduces the overall weight of the AKM. This configuration comes equipped with an aimpoint sight for ease of use against distant targets as well as a suppressor, making it a more stealthy choice.

[AK74sutMG]
Description=The AK-74 was developed as a response to design criticisms of the AK-47 and AKM rifles. Particularly, it dropped the 7.62x39mm ammunition down to 5.45x39mm in order to address concerns that the bullets overpenetrated their targets, a chrome-lined barrel bore to reduce maintenance, and a set of brackets for underbarrel attachments. This particular model, a carbine variant often called a ''Krinkov'',  is more suited to close quarters combat scenarios.

[Taser]
Description=Stun guns work on the principle of Electro-Muscular Disruption (EMD).  This projectile model fires small electrodes into the target and then sends a powerful electric charge down the thin wires.  The EMD effect causes involuntary contraction of the target's muscle tissue regardless of an individual's pain tolerance or mental focus.  The effect is painful and demoralizing to even the most aggressive suspects.||EMD devices have three key drawbacks.  The first is that they have a relatively short range.  The second is that new electrodes must be loaded after each shot. Lastly, EMD poses numerous risks, including possible cardiac arrest in drug users, the elderly, or those with specific medical conditions.

[Stingray]
Description=The X2 model is a dual-purpose less-lethal weapon. It possesses both a ranged means of Electro-Muscular Disruption (EMD) and a touch-stun mode. The electrical discharge causes involuntary contraction of the target's muscle tissue, regardless of an individual's pain tolerance or mental focus.  The effect is painful and demoralizing to even the most aggressive suspects. The X2 can fire darts in groups of four or two separate groups of two. It can also be used in touch-stun mode as a melee weapon. An onboard computer records information on shock intensity and duration, among other factors. The main drawback is the reduced range of the X2 cartridges in comparison to the older M26C model. The X2 features an integral flashlight.

[C2Charge]
Description=The door breaching charge is a powerful and devastating method of breaching a door.  The compact and specially designed charge destroys the locking mechanism of the door and forcefully opens the door at the same time.  The noise and shock of the detonation causes people on the opposite side of the door to react in a similar manner to a flashbang detonation, which can provide a tactical advantage for using it instead of the breaching shotgun.  The C2 breaching charge is an explosive and can injure or kill anyone unlucky enough to be directly behind the door.

[Wedge]
Description=This specially designed tactical wedge is slid under the door and then activated.  The spring loaded action flips up wedges preventing the door from opening from either direction.  The rubber coating along the bottom of the wedge increases friction making it extremely difficult to push open with brute force.  It can only be removed with a cutting tool reducing the risk of a suspect dislodging the device.

It is an invaluable tool for gathering intelligence on suspect and civilian locations before performing dangerous clear routines and potentially exposing your team to fire.
FriendlyName=Opti-Wand

[PepperSpray]
Description=While generally used for riot control, handheld pepper spray canisters can be an effective tool for subduing uncooperative targets.  The active ingredient in pepper spray is Oleoresin Capsicum or OC.  OC is an inflammatory agent that causes the eyes to swell up and close.  It also causes a burning sensation on any exposed skin.  Due to its limited range and area of effect it is best used in addition to other non-lethal devices to cause a suspect or hostage to comply.

[stingGrenade]
Description=The CTS Model 9590 sting-ball grenade is filled with many small rubber balls.  Upon detonation these balls are ejected from the grenade, bombarding targets with blunt force projectiles.  The rubber balls will not penetrate the skin but can cause dizzyness, disorientation, and severe pain from the impact of the projectiles. ||While considered less lethal, the sting grenade can cause severe injury if it detonates in very close proximity to someone.
