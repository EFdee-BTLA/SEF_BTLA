### v1.2 ###

Suppressed Assault Rifles muzzlevelocities have been reverted so now they are as punchy as before
MP5, MP5A5, MP5SD5, MP5SD6 and UMP Aimpoint position has been fixed to fit like they do in real life, providing a much clear view of your targets
UZI now has 32 rounds instead of 25
Some suppressed weapons GUI ammo were incorrectly labeled as non-subsonic ammo.
UMP 45, SG552 and Colt SMG now have new sound both for their regular and suppressed versions
Third Person weapon sounds have been buffed up, now they have 6db's plus as their First Person counterparts
Shell Casings aren't as loud as before
Some GUI sounds have been changed
Footsteps sounds have been improved, they aren't as heavy as before but they are still easy to distinguish, and loud enough to clearly hear them.
Earrape pump sound when firing the M870 has been fixed
Glock 21 suppressed, Glock 17 suppressed and Glock 19 either had a wrong bulk or weight values. For   example. the Glock 19 had the same bulk as the Glock 21 (WTF), ruining the main purpose of the   gun.
Zoomed FOV has been changed to 75 to provide a better view while aiming down sights
C2 standalone, x3 pack and x5 pack now work as they should, before, you would get 3 charges even if you choose the standalone version.
Lockpicking, removing wedges and removing C2s time has been changed to 8.0 seconds so it's a lot more viable now. Defusing a bomb now takes between 10-12 seconds.
Flashbangs fuse time now is 1.0 seconds. 
CS Gas cloud isn't as big as before, providing a better view of your targets.
Dynamic Mode and Stealth Mode (AKA Run and Walk) now can be differentiated between each other, Stealth is  now truly stealth, moving slowly, while Dynamic now is truly Dynamic, you move a lot   faster when you need  to. Crouching speed has been adjusted to be a bit slower than Stealth. Light Armor, Heavy Armor and No  Armor have different speed base values. Light Armor (195) Heavy Armor   (185) No Armor (205). Also, you now  run by holding the shift key, instead of just toggling it.
Armor has been improved, now it will truly protect you from ballistics, of course, this won't make you  invincible but you won't go down as easy as before while using Helmets and/or Armor. Helmets that have  goggles, glasses or ballistic visors now provide an increased protection.
Pro-Tec + Fernez Gas Mask has been added
Oakley's glasses now protect you from pepperspray instead of flashbangs.
Score system has been improved a bit more, now killing suspects give you an slightly higher score (0.55).  Yes, killing suspects give you a small bonus. Trap trigger penalty has been removed, it  was stupid. Now  when you display a penalty message on screen, depending on the type of penalty (if it was critical or not)  they will display a different color. For example, killing a hostage will display a red text instead of  yellow.
AI reaction times have been improved to a greater extent, now suspects are harder than before, especially  Medium and High level suspects. They reaction times are counted in miliseconds, but this  is the same for  officers to stay on par with suspects. Other changes are the chances that suspects have to perform certain  actions, for example, when they flee, there's a higher chance that they  will lock doors and barricade  there, or when you look away and you didn't cuffed a complaint suspect, they will get a higher bonus to  their morale and they will try to flee (this may vary between archetypes). Other minor changes have been  done but they aren't as important as these
Some enemy archetypes have been revised
Multiplayer skins have been added, for now, only 10 ten of them. Most of them consist on default SP skins   but tweaked for MP, for example, Red Team has a black uniform as they did in Vanilla and  you can choose  between Reynolds or Girard, the same goes for Blue Team.
Source code is now available in the Extras folder, i've also included the official BTLA Icon and  Singleplayer skins there. 
Decals like bullet holes, blood and explosions as well as shell casings now last a lot longer (1 minute) 
Shotgun spread has been improved, so now 18" barrel shotguns are accurate and more viable than before, while 14" barrel shotguns spread is worse.
Iron Sight view has been improved (STILL A WIP), this means that they no longer have Zoom but you can still see your targets very clear (M4A1 and variants (CQBR), G36c and variants, MP5 and   variants (MP5A5, MP5SD), P90 and variants, Colt SMG and variants, AKM and variants, SG552 and variants done for now) Thanks to Sphee for this suggestion.
